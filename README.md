# EscapeFromPatmos
A text-based adventure game. This command line interface game originated as a simple c++ assignment but grew into much more. I really enjoyed creating this game and I hope you enjoy playing it.


##### Compiling the Game #####
Download the zip file from this GitHub page.
<br />Unzip the "EscapeFromPatmos-master" folder.
<br />Open up a new terminal at the new folder.
<br />The "ls" command should show a list of all the files.
<br />Once you are in the correct directory (should be something like Users/.../Downloads/EscapeFromPatmos-master) 
<br />Compile the game by typing this in the commandline: *g++ \*.cpp -g -std=c++11 -m32 -o game.exe*


##### Running the Game #####
Once the game has compiled type: *./game.exe*
